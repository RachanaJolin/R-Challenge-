#MPG Regression

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
: I generated scatter plots with each variable to understand the relationship between dependent , and the 
multiple variables. Vehicle length appeared to have the most linear relationship with mpg. 
AWD appeared to have the least. 

cor(mpg_cars$mpg, mpg_cars$`vehicle weight`)
[1] 0.09068314
> cor(mpg_cars$mpg, mpg_cars$`vehicle length`)
[1] 0.6094798
> cor(mpg_cars$mpg, mpg_cars$`spoiler angle`)
[1] -0.02083999
> cor(mpg_cars$mpg, mpg_cars$`ground clearance`)
[1] 0.3287489
> cor(mpg_cars$mpg, mpg_cars$`AWD`)
[1] -0.1416698

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 
No, the slope of this model will not be Zero
regardless of the independent variable. None of the variables have a completely linear relationship with the independent
variable- I predited this via my scatter plot studies. 
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? 
If we do a multiple regression(include all the given variables), then I believe our prediction will not be as accurate. 
I would remove the vehicle weight, the spoiler angle, and the AWD from the study. I strongly believe that vehicle length
and the ground clearance would alone provide better predictability. (correlation coefficents of both those variables
are closest to 1 when compared to the others). Vehicle Length appears to predict MPG more accurately than any other
variable.

Suspension Coil Summary:
I downloaded the psych package for R and used that to get the summary statistics for the suspension coil data

The current manufacturing DOES meet the standard - the variance is 62.29, and the standard deviation is 7.89- 
both these stats tell  us that the manufacturing of the coil is well within the spec that the variance of the
suspension coils must not exceed 100lbs/inch. (62.29 +7.89= <100)

Suspension Coil T-Test
Using the same suspension coil data and the MechaCarChallenge.RScript file, determine if the suspension coilâ€™s 
pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch. 

I used one sample t-test because I'm comparing to a known standard of 1500 lbs/inch.

T_test<-t.test(S_Coil$PSI,mu=1500)
> print(T_test)

	One Sample t-test

data:  S_Coil$PSI
t = -1.8931, df = 149, p-value = 0.06028
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1497.507 1500.053
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  1498.78 

The t-value measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in your sample data. Since our p-value is 
larger than 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

Design Your Own Study
Metrics that would interest a client - fuel efficieny, cost and then color. Since we have been looking
at mpg- I'm assuming that fuel efficiency is the most important criteria- and in return- the vehicle length and 
ground clearnace would be most critical.
Null Hypothesis : Ground clearnace has no affect on mpg. 
Alternative Hypothessis : Ground Clearance does have an affect on mpg
We could use one sample t test, with the the known standard of "customer required MPG"

for required variables.
